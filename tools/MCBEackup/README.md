Simple as white; Powershell based Windows 10+ utility for backing up natural Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Data.  

## Usage
Two ways to do such.  
1. [Download and run the file manually](###download-manually-to-run)  
2. [`iwr` in powershell](###run-through-iwr)  

### Download manually to run
You can download the file and run it manually, but it comes with it's cons:  
- If I update the script, you won't be notified.  
- You will need to redownload the script every update.  

### Run through iwr
This is the better way to do it.
1. Press Windows Key on your keyboard, type `powershell` and Press **Enter**.  
  \(_**OR**_ Press Windows Key + R, type `powershell` and Press **Enter**.
2. In the new window that pops up, type:
  ```powershell

  ```
