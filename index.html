<!-- Ok guys see I tootally suc at html and i cooked tis page
     in like .. 1 day .. previously there used to be an audio
     player on this page, hence why i said it took me so much time
     the audio player is awesome and is taken from
     github/DeadSuperHero/myspace-music-player-extended or
     codeberg.org/deadsuperhero/myspace-music-player-extended
     with like barely much tweaks... except some stylistic changes and
     file path changes and as such i was originally gonna include a
     diff of my tweaks but im tired oh well yah ok good night
-->

<!-- side note: i just realized this myspace player clone is built
     off of a javascript library called amplitudeJS; i have 0 clue
     how i didn't notice this earlier but oh well i do now
     i need to lock in for js 100% 100%
-->

<!-- side-side note: i learned like 5 new things about js today to
     randomly chose between the two songs i have which are chosen at
     page load... wow... the sky is the limit...
-->

<!-- side-side-side note: i forgot what i was gonna say...
     well...

     i remember i used to spend so many hours with my friends in my
     flat minecraft semi-creative world... i was trying to figure out
     a way to add progression to the flat world... but then i just
     ended up lettin it be and ... well... ... friends... one was my
     classmate and so many those ive never seen personally or dont
     know what they look like, are named, but i had fun with them...
     haha..
     reminds me of this gamergirl person who once asked me if they
     looked old and i said yes so they started tweaking out hahaha...
     dang... its been a while..
     miss yall

     hope we could come together once more and talk and play and
     explore...

     bot..

     JUST found him and then lost contact again...

     thats a story for another day though...
     hope we all could come together again.. and talk.. and play..
     cherish our old memories..
     but do they all feel the same way about me and us all.. like
     i do?..

     nonetheless.. i cherish them.. very dearly
